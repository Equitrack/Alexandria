I'm working in Global Hitss like infrastructure engineer.
I have 4 activities:
- Update HTTPS certificates to web servers like nginx

- To do documentation about technical processes and new technology researched
	- The technical processes could be how to resolve some type of tickets
	- The research example is Argo, Argo is an alternative technology to deploy applications, we can use Argo instead of jenkins
- Resolve tickets about the operation
	- Create and develop containers, my last develop container was kubescape, it was a technology to improve the security to other containers
	- Check build and deploy fails during the automatic deploy with jenkins
	- To do troubleshooting about some container, sometime using many memory or CPU
